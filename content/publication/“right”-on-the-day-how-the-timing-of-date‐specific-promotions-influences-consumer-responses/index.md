abstract: While it is common for companies to send greetings that include
  special promotions to their customers on special days (e.g., birthdays,
  holidays, etc.), consumers express mixed responses to such date-specific
  promotions. Building upon the persuasion knowledge model, the present work
  examines the conditions under which sending date-specific promotions lead to
  favorable consumer responses. In four studies, we demonstrate that consumers
  respond to date-specific promotions more positively when they are sent in
  advance than when they are sent on specific days, especially for companies
  perceived as less warm (vs. warm). Sending promotions on the exact day elicits
  an ulterior motive inference from consumers regarding the company, which can
  be alleviated by sending promotions in advance. We further find that this
  effect is weakened when the message includes only greetings without
  highlighting specific promotional information. These findings have important
  implications for marketers regarding how firms should design date-specific
  promotions and communicate with their customers.
